# Archive.Today CSS Improver

A browser extension that improves readability on Archive.Today by removing visual clutter and enhancing contrast.

## What it does

This extension modifies CSS on [archive.today](https://archive.ph/) to:
- Remove the grey border around content
- Replace grey backgrounds with white for better readability
- Make the header background white
- Hide percentage indicators/progress elements that can be distracting
- Overall improves readability and reduces visual clutter

## Compatibility

- **Browsers:** Chrome, Brave, Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers
- **Websites:** Specifically designed for archive.ph/archive.today

## Installation

Since this isn't published on Chrome Web Store, you'll need to install it manually:

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open your browser and go to the extensions page:
   - Chrome: `chrome://extensions/`
   - Brave: `brave://extensions/`
   - Edge: `edge://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder

## Files

- `manifest.json` - Extension configuration
- `content.css` - CSS modifications
- Icon files for the extension

## Why not on Chrome Web Store?

I'd love to publish this there for easier installation, but Google charges a $5 developer fee that's not in my budget right now. Maybe in the future!
